## Hi!

### I am Vitaly. 

Python developer with experience of Deplhi developing and system administration.

### About me: 
I have profile education. And whole my life was near tech-theme. Even when my work was not straight connected to IT, I used to automate my routine tasks.<br>
Now I have started my Python-way and want to find a job and great team to absorb information from professionals and work on interesting projects.<br>
My previous expirience as Delphi dev gave me a solid base.<br>
My vector have been directing to Python way in 2022 year. I used to write on Python before, but my knowledges were spaced.<br>
I have started from attentionaly reading Lutz's Book 'Learning Python' and Luciano Ramalho's 'Fluent Python'.<br>

In process I learned Django, Django REST, HTML, CSS, SQL, JS, Docker. 
Maybe my knowledges of any of this are not perfect but I learn permanently and have passion.
